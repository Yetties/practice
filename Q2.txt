Write a linked list structure, in which each node stores an int. 

Provide the following API:
- insert(int): insert a node with the int data into the front of the list.
- pop: return the head node and remove it from the list.
- clear: remove all nodes from the list.
- contains(int): return the first node that matches the data. Return NULL if not found.
